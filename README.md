# Smart Sticky Component

Package which is inspired from facebook sticky scroller.  


A **Smart Sticky** component built with React and TypeScript, designed to create a "sticky" effect on elements as you scroll, similar to the one used on Facebook's interface. The sticky component intelligently sticks within a designated container and respects the boundaries of other elements, providing a smooth and unobtrusive user experience.
